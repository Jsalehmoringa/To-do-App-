# Task Management Application
Welcome to our task management website! Our platform is a user-friendly and intuitive tool designed to help you keep track of your tasks and stay organized, no matter how busy your life gets.

Creating an account is quick and easy. Simply click on the "Sign Up" button and fill in your information. Once you have created your account, you will have access to all of our features, including the ability to create, update, and delete tasks.

To create a new task, click on the "New Task" button and enter the necessary details. You can set a due date, assign a priority level, and add any additional notes or attachments you need to keep track of.

Updating a task is just as simple. Click on the task you want to edit and make any necessary changes. You can update the due date, priority level, and any other details as needed.

If you no longer need a task on your list, you can easily delete it by clicking on the task and selecting "Delete". This will remove the task from your list and free up space for new tasks.

Our platform is built with Node.js for the back-end, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the front-end.
